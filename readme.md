## About Topic Allocation System
This entire system is focused upon the topic seletion of "New Final Year Project topic allocation system".

This allows to inform, propose and distribute information to incoming Aston University Final Year Students.

Upon review of the old system and critical suggestions and changes from staff and interviewed lecturers, it has been stripped of from it's automated allocation, but is to currently retain a manual user-instructed allocation.
