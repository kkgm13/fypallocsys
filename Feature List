Future implementation
-------
Multiple studentsâ€™ allocations (Investigating Options)
Skills Set Filter (Doable but require additional checks with tagging)
Controversial: Past students to post reflective experience about the system. (Will require a complete review)
Diary Uploads (Would require some sort of implemenetation and custom cluster implementation)
Allow to cross reference with other supervisors (related project)
	[Allow uniqueness of the system, but requires additional information with previous topics used] (Check if possible, with Laravel validation)
In-table Cell editing (Doable but requires paid system)
